# PharmacoEquity
[Dr. Utibe Essien coined the term "pharmacoequity"](https://www.uressien.com/), which  expresses "...the goal of ensuring that everyone, regardless of race or social class, has access to life-saving medicines." 

# Foundations for PharmacoEquity
This organization is dedicated to identifying, commpiling, and developing resources to serve as a part of the research and policy infrastructre to  achieve pharmacoequity.  I invite everyone to join and help share and advance the knowledge, tools, and plans needed to achieve pharmacoequity.
