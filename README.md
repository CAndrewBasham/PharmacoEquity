# PharmacoEquity
The term pharmacoequity was coined by Dr. Utibe Essien, who defines it as: _"[..the goal of ensuring that everyone, regardless of race or social class, has access to life-saving medicines.]([url](https://www.uressien.com/))"_ This repository is dedicated to building resources to serve as a part of the growing need for reserarch and policy infrastructre to  achieve pharmacoequity.  I have created an organization: "Foundations for PharmacoEquity", to which I invite all interested people to join or follow to help identify, create, and share the knowledge, tools, and actions needed to achieve pharmacoequity.

Thank you for your interest.

I look forward to hearing from you.


Sincerely,

C. Andrew Basham, PhD
